### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into employee attrition at IBM by comparing the characteristics of employees who have left the company with those who remain employed. The goal is to identify key trends, understand factors influencing employee turnover, and make data-driven recommendations that can help improve employee retention and overall company performance.

### Data Sources
HR Attrition Data: The data was sourced from Kaggle and contains both demographic and job-related attributes of employees.

### Tools and Technologies Used
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib
  - Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib
  - Data Processing: Pandas for data manipulation, handling missing values
    
### Insights and Findings
- High Attrition in Life Sciences & Medical Educational Fields: Employees with backgrounds in Life Sciences and Medical education fields are more likely to leave the company, possibly due to job dissatisfaction or workload-related challenges.
- Impact of Age Band and Gender: Employees aged between 31-40, particularly males, have the highest attrition rate.
- Marital Status Influence: Single males exhibit a significantly higher attrition rate compared to divorced employees.
- Work Life Balance: depends on a number of factors like age, job satisfaction, Monthly income, overtime, job role etc 
    - Age – Younger employees may seek work-life balance more than older employees.
    - Job Role/Department – Some roles (e.g., Research & Development, sales) may have higher workload demands.
    - Working Hours Per Week – Long hours can lead to burnout and higher attrition.
    - Overtime (Yes/No) – Frequent overtime reduces work-life balance.
    - Job Satisfaction (1-4 scale) – Directly linked to retention.
    - Work-Life Balance Rating (1-4 scale) – Poor ratings correlate with higher attrition.
    - Number of Leaves Taken – Employees who rarely take leave might be overworked.
    - Stress Level (1-5 scale) – High stress leads to higher turnover.
    - Attrition (Yes/No) – Whether the employee has left the company.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis I would recommend the follwing actions:
- Improve Work-Life Balance: Offer flexible work arrangements and well-being programs.
- Increase Job Satisfaction: Conduct regular employee feedback surveys and act on concerns.

### Conclusion
By leveraging Python for analysis, I identified key drivers of employee attrition. Addressing the highlighted areas can improve employee retention and reduce turnover costs.
